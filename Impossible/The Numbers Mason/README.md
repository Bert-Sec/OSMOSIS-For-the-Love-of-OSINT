## Challenge Description
```
A hum, a pulse, a secret beat,
A rhythm guides where shadows meet.
Invisible paths, a code unknown,
Through endless voids, its song is sown.

Each note a whisper, soft and stark,
A key to light within the dark.
Fragments linger, threads entwine,
A language shaped by the divine.

It calls to minds that dare to hear,
Through static’s veil, it draws them near.
A story told in tones unseen,
A map of worlds that lie between.

Follow the tune, let silence bend,
For every sound, a cryptic end.
The answer hums, the truth aligns—
A chorus sung in phantom lines.
FLAG{XXXX_XXXXXXX}
