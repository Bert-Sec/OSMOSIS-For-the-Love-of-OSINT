# On Their Tail
**Category**: Impossible

**Value**: 50

**ID**: 94

## Challenge Description
```
The trail runs cold, the clues run thin,
Yet deeper still, the truth lies within.
A secret buried, a step unseen,
A hidden path where they’ve surely been.

The shadows whisper, the echoes call,
There’s more to find beyond the wall.
So back we go, retrace, reveal,
To uncover the truth they tried to conceal.
