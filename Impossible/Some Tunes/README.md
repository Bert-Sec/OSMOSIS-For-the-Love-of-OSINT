**ID**: 106

## Challenge Description
```
In shadows deep, the silence grew,
A figure moved, its purpose true.	
No trace, no sound, just whispered air,
A quiet theft, unseen, unfair.
What was the price, whatâ€™s gone next without trace?
What is the name of the darkened place?
FLAG{XXXXX XX XXXXXX}

```
