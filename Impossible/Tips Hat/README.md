## Challenge Description
```
The game’s afoot, the chase is near,
Clues unravel, the path grows clear.
Footsteps echo, a fleeting trace,
Hints left dangling, time to face.

Smoke and mirrors, shadows play,
Yet truth emerges, come what may.
With every turn, the web is spun,
The case unwinds; we’ve just begun.

A question lingers, sharp, precise,
A mystery bound in cryptic vice.
The answer waits, the final prize—
What is the flag, beneath the lies?
FLAG{XXXXXXXX_XX_XXXXXXX}
```
